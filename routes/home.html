                <h3>Size</h3>
                <p>
                    Hamsters are known as pocket pets, and are small enough for a child to carry with ease. Their size
                    makes them portable enough to accompany you wherever you go. Make sure to keep your hamster secure
                    when you carry her. If you drop her while you stand or walk, she could break a leg. Keep a good hold
                    on her. Hamsters are excellent escape artists
                </p>

                <h3>Fun to Watch</h3>
                <p>Hamsters are speedy, curious and energetic, and offer tons of entertainment. You can sit beside the
                    cage, and watch your hamster at work and play as she burrows and climbs. Outside the cage, she will
                    explore the environment and use you as a jungle gym, scrambling up your arms and crawling over your
                    legs.</p>

                <h3>Small Habitat</h3>
                <p>
                    You don't need a huge yard or a nearby park for your tiny pal to romp in. You won't need a roomy
                    crate or doghouse, either. Hamster habitats come in many sizes and you can buy one that fits your
                    living space. Make sure your pet has space to explore and climb. Some plastic habitats have movable
                    tubes that can be attached to extend the habitat's space.

                                    Watching your hamster go about his business in his habitat can be very entertaining,
                                    but you may also want to take him out of his cage. Here are a few helpful tips to
                                    keep him safe.
                                </p>

                            <div class="panel">
                                <p>Your hamster will do best in a cage larger than 600 square inches, although 450
                                    square inches or 30 inches by 15 inches is the minimum. It should also be more than
                                    12 inches tall so as to be able to fir an adequately sized wheel, 10-12 inches for
                                    Syrians and 8 inches for Dwarfs. A glass aquarium (as long as it meets the minimum
                                    floor space) is a great home for a hamster. The disadvantage is the lack of
                                    ventilation, so make sure the lid wire mesh to allow for air movement.
                                    An IKEA Detolf is an excellent choice too. Alternatively, the "cat tray with a wire
                                    top" type of hamster cage do have good natural ventilation.
                                    Make sure your cage is not in direct sunlight as your hamster could overheat due to
                                    the bright rays magnifying on the aquarium glass. Unless they're second hand,
                                    aquariums can be expensive.

                                    Make sure there is plenty of ventilation. Don't place the cage in front of a hot
                                    window. Make sure to find a place that is quiet and free of any other household pets
                                    such as dogs and cats. This will reduce the stress of your pet hamster. At no point
                                    should you let your dogs or cats interact with your hamster
                                </p>

                                    Provide your hamster with enough food each day to fill both cheeks, approximately
                                    15g (1/2oz) for a Syrian hamster or 8g (1/4oz) for a Dwarf hamster. Make sure you
                                    provide fresh food in their bowl every day. Your hamster is a hoarder, so it'll keep
                                    private stashes. Removing these stashes can be very stressful, so if you are worried
                                    about the quality of their stored food, remove it and replace it with fresh food
                                    exactly where your hamster had it.
                                    Choose an earthenware or metal dish for their food. This is the best type of feeding
                                    bowl as your hamster will simply chew through a plastic one.
